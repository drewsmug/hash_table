# hash_table
hast table implemented in C

main.c is a test bed. It mostly works.
I think there are some problems after growing the hash table to many times.
I remember I was going to redo and fix it and don't remember if I started or where I stopped.
I thought this would be useful to just see some additional C code that I worked on for a few evenings a long time ago.
